My name is Sergey Ryumin and I am 24 years old. I have been studying programming for 7 years and have been working professionally for 3 years. My main expertise is C++, developing desktop applications using Qt. Programming is both my job and my hobby, and I also spend a lot of my free time programming.

I enjoy learning different aspects of programming, not just those that I use in my daily work. I actively study Go and Rust and use them in my pet projects. I also love Python, which I use for most of the automation in my work process. It is important for me to develop in various directions and technologies in my work.

I strive for my work to not only be efficient and professional, but also beautiful and intuitive for users. I believe that programming is not just a science, but also an art that can improve people's lives and make the world a better place.
