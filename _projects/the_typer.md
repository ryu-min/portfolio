### Project description

TheTyper is a typing speed trainer project that consists of two subprojects: TyperDesktop and TyperWord. TyperDesktop is a cross-platform desktop application written in Qt6, while TyperWord is a server application written in Go using the Gin framework.

The goal of the project is to provide users with a tool to improve their typing skills by practicing typing at different speeds. TyperDesktop provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to practice typing, while TyperWord handles the logic and data storage for the typing exercises.

The project is open-source and contributions are welcome from the community
